# UnoBot [![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/mjsalerno/UnoBot/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mjsalerno/UnoBot/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

UnoBot is an IRC bot that is written in java. It has a pircbotx back end so it's easy to change settings. 
The bot connects to an IRC server/channel
and allows members of the channel to play a game of uno. It also has an AI so it can play too.

## Requirements

1. You must have Java 1.7 JDK or higher installed.
2. The Java bin folder must be in your classpath if you are running windows.
3. Maven

## Installation

1. open the config.ini file
2. edit the values appropriately
3. run `mvn package` (you will have to cd to UnoBot's directory)
4. run `UnoBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` using the `java -jar ./target/UnoBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` command

### values in the config file

        Server - if no value given it will default to localhost
		
        Port - if no value given it will default to 6667
        
		Channel - the channel the bot connects to default to #uno
        
		Nick - if no value given it will default to unoBot
		
		AINick - if no value given it will default to unoAI
        
		BotOps - if no value given it will default to null

			the first user in this list should be the owner.
		
		UpdateScript - if an BotOps in the channel says "!update" 
			this script will run. if using a 'nix shell script
			a "./" may be required.
		
		ScoreBoardFileName - the name of the file you want the 
			score board to be saves to so when the unoBot exits
			it will still keep everyones score. If no value given it 
			default to "ScoreBoard.dat"

        SSL - set this to true if you would like the bot to connect to
            the server using an SSL connection. The default is false.

        Token - change the default token from '!' to whatever you want.
            e.g. for the default token you type !uno but if token
            was changed to '?' then you would type ?uno
            
        nickSrvPasswd - password to authenticate against NICKSERV
        
        serverPasswd - the password for IRC server
        
        webIRCPasswd - the password of WEBIRC connection

        aiNickSrvPasswd - password to authenticate against NICKSERV for the uno AI
        
        aiServerPasswd - the password for IRC server for the uno AI
